      "Description: QR Code Link to This PostThis hinged table top can turn a rectangular dining room or patio table into a large round table that can seat twelve. This was a DIY project made of 3/8\" plywood with a piano hinge to allow for easy storage and moving it through doorways. When unfolded it has a 78\" diameter. It doesn't have a nice finished surface, so it was used with a table cloth. It comes with a 35.5\" lazy Susan made of 3/4\" particle board that spins easily. I couldn't get a photo of the hinged table top as I don't have a place to easily set it up. The photos show both sides of the lazy Susan. It is located in Point Richmond.\n",
