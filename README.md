# Web Scraping and Automation Study

## Overview
This repository documents my personal exploration into web scraping and automation using Python. It includes scripts for interacting with web pages, extracting information, and automating web interactions. The focus is on Craigslist listings and automating login processes for 'The Old Reader'.

## Objectives
- **Dynamic Interaction with Web Pages**: Learn to manipulate URLs to sort and navigate through Craigslist listings.
- **Extracting Web Content**: Develop skills in using Beautiful Soup for fetching and parsing HTML to extract detailed information from web listings.
- **Automation of Web Processes**: Implement scripts to automate login procedures and understand the mechanics of session management in web applications.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Requests**: Library for making HTTP requests in Python.
- **Beautiful Soup**: Library for parsing HTML and XML documents.

## Setup and Installation
To set up the necessary environment for running these scripts, ensure Python is installed and then install the required packages:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
